## What?
It's [alexjs](http://alexjs.com/) in a chrome extension!

I'm not very creative with names.

# Why?
I went to a meeting with some absolute legends, including my friends Adam, Bec, Aubrey, Dome, Andrew and DP, where we spoke about encouraging diversity and empathy among our peers, when Aubrey told us about this wicked JavaScript library called [alexjs](http://alexjs.com/) and hinted that I should write a HipChat plugin for it, since Slack has one already. Well I decided to write a Chrome extension instead. (Sorry for letting you down, Aubrey.)

My hope for this is that it encourages people to think about the language they use, and try to become more empathetic and encouraging towards others. There's too much hate these days. Lets see some more love.

## Where?
Right in your browser!

## How?
We take the text content of the web page that is being viewed, and run it through the alexjs library. Once we get the results, they're shown back to you. For massively complicated web pages, like your Facebook feed, it might take a while.

So if you're writing a blog post, a readme or an article, you can check that you're still being empathetic!

Peace and Love everyone
