It's [alexjs](http://alexjs.com/) in a chrome extension!


I'm not very creative with names.

# Why?
I went to a meeting with some absolute legends, including my friends Adam, Bec, Aubrey, Dome, Andrew and DP, where we spoke about encouraging diversity and empathy among our peers, when Aubrey told us about this wicked JavaScript library called [alexjs](http://alexjs.com/) and hinted that I should write a HipChat plugin for it, since Slack has one already. Well I decided to write a Chrome extension instead.

My hope for this is that it encourages people to think about the language they use, and try to become more empathetic and encouraging towards others. There's too much hate these days. Lets see some more love.

*But Jake, isn't this just Political Correctness gone too far?*
No, this isn't about being Politically Correct, this is about not being a dickhead!

Peace and Love everyone

Cheers,
Jake
